# How to individually change the view type of an auto-created series


<p>This example demonstrates how an <a href="http://devexpress.com/Help/Content.aspx?help=XtraCharts&document=CustomDocument5795.htm">auto-created series</a> (a series generated automatically based on the series template settings) can be accessed at runtime, to individually change its <a href="http://devexpress.com/Help/Content.aspx?help=XtraCharts&document=CustomDocument5776.htm">view type</a>.</p><p>This is performed in a special <strong>BoundDataChanged</strong> event of the chart control.</p>
